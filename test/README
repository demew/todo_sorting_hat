So far all that is in here is a skeleton testing section provided by Sam.  I have changed some of the naming of objects from his initial plumbing so at present these tests are not operational (although they were written initially to "start with a fail".)  I am delaying refining this further until I have a better grasp on the entire organization of my application.
